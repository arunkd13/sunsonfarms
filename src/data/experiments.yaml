action: >
  Tilled 1st bed of Field 5. Later bed became wet with overflown irrigation
  water and some light sprinkles of rain. Broadcasted black horse gram seeds.
  The seeds were damaged due to moisture. Over seeded to compensate. Lightly
  hoed the bed once again after broadcasting the seeds.
expected: >
  The seeds germinate in a week. Sufficient growth to overcome weeds and fair yields.

action: >
  Broadcasted mucuna seeds on the first two trenches of Field 2 and hoed to
  cover them with soil.
expected: >
  Expecting germination in two weeks and profuse growth throughout the year
  smothering other weeds. This should be better than previous attempt at growing
  mucuna on the beds, where the growth was poor doe to lack of moisture. Mucuna
  should die with water logging due to NE monsoon, and before it sets seeds.
  This will ensure that, the field is not infested with Mucuna the next season.

date: 2025-01-10
action: >
  Broadcasted green gram seeds on one trench on the Food Forest 1 and hoed to
  cover the seed.
expected: >
  Seeds germinate with sufficient growth that by the time of next irrigation in
  a week or two, it is able to survive an hour of flooding during irrigation.
  Growth should also be better than the beds, where irrigation water does not
  wet the soil.

date: 2025-01-10
action: >
  Broadcasted black horse gram seeds that were damaged due to moisture, onto 3
  trenches on Food Forest 1. Then lightly hoed the trench to cover the seeds.
expected: >
  Seeds germinate in a week and they survive an hour of flooding when
  irrigating. Growth should be better than beds where the irrigation water is
  not able to wet the soil.

date: 2025-01-03
action: >
  Tilled Field 1, broadcasted black gram, rosella, ground nut and sunn hemp,
  raked them into the soil and irrigated field.
expected: >
  Good germination in a week and a good harvest.
eta: 2025-01-03
observations:
  -
    date: 2025-01-10
    note: Fair germination

date: 2024-12-27
action: >
  Broadcasted Pigen Pea, Pulicha Keerai, Green Gram and Sunn Hemp seeds and then
  tilled the soil to kill the grass and weed cover. The weed cover was quite
  heavy even though this area has been cultivated for a year. Soil was wet on
  the first day, but the rest of the weeks are expected to be dry.
expected: >
  Likely the seeds will not germinate because of lack of moisture and also
  because they got buried too deep. I will need to broadcast seeds again and
  bury them once again, followed by immediate irrigation.
eta: 2025-01-03
observations:

    date: 2025-01-10
    note: >
      There was some germination a week later.

date: 2024-12-04
action: >
  Transplanted cow pea that were damaged with water logging, onto drier bunds.
  This was on wet soil with adequete rains.
expected: Plants recover and grow with good yields.
eta: 2025-02-04
observations:
  -
    date: 2025-01-10
    note: >
      Plants survived, but still short. Lots of weeds around. Some plants have
      started flowering and bearing pods.
---
date: 2024-12-17
action: Sowed horsegram on high bunds in wet soil with some expected immediate rains.
expected: Good germination and growth
eta: 2025-03-17
observations:
  -
    date: 2025-01-10
    note: >
      Germinated, but with no rains, growth is low. Irrigation water does not
      wet the high bund.
---
date: 2024-12-09
action: >
  Created trench around saplings with high mounds around stem to prevent damage
  from water logging.
expected: Saplings survive heavy NE monsoon.
eta: 2025-01-15
observations:

date: 2024-12-01
action: >
  Winding trench on the crop field to drain heavy rain water and also used for
  irrigation.
expected: >
  Crops survive heavy NE monsoon. Should also be able to grow irrigated crop
  after rains.
eta: 2024-03-01
observations:
  -
    date: 2025-01-04
    note: >
      Irrigation was smooth.

date: 2024-12-17
action: >
  Collected cow dung and started compost heap.
expected: >
  Able to get rich compost in less than 3 months. Should be able to use it for
  making seeed pellets and also for emergency fertilization for fruit saplings
  that show low growth.
eta: 2024-03-17
observations:
  -
    date: 2025-01-03
    note: >
      The area remained dry. So moved the compost heap onto beginning of
      alternate beds that is near the pathway, so that irrigation water wets the
      heap.
---
date: 2024-12-25
action: >
  Tilled bed that had never been tilled and containing heavy bermuda grass and
  other weeds. This was before the final heavy NE monsoon rains.
expected: >
  Able to broadcast seeds and lightly hoe once water has sufficiently drained
  after NE monsoon.
eta: 2025-01-25
observations:

date: 2024-11-01
action: >
  Planted cow pea onto bed 1 of Field 1.
expected: >
  Expectation they survive NE monsoon and
  provide good yield.
eta: 2025-02-01
observations:
  -
    date: 2025-01-10
    note: >
      Fair number of plants survived floowing due to NE monsoon. Survived
      plants had profuse growth after the last rain and bore pods in just a week.

date: 2024-11-17
action: >
  Planted custard apple seeds directly on mounds with wet soil condition and
  likely rains in a few days.
expected: >
  Seeds germinate in NE monsoon in a month or two

observations:
---
date: 2024-11-13
action: >
  Sowed horsegram directly on untilled soil with thick grass cover and had to
  deep hoe it. Seeds were buried more than 3 inches. Soil was wet with rains
  that day.
expected: >
  Horsegram germinates with NE monsoon rains in a week.
eta: 2024-12-01
observations:
  -
    date: 2024-12-14
    note: Just one or two seeds germinated.
result: failure
learning: >
  For untilled toil, it is better to till once without seeding. Then after
  letting the plant mass to dry, the area can be seeded and then either raked or
  lightly hoed to bury the seeds at a lower depth.
---
date: 2024-11-13
action: >
  Sowed Mucuna on the bunds of the winding irrigation trench. This was just
  before the heavy NE monsoon rains.
expected: >
  Mucuna germinates with the rains and grow profusely with the ample water fromt
  he NE monsoon rains.
observations:
  -
    date: 2024-12-26
    note: >
      Mucuna seeds likely rotted due to water logging from heavy NE monsoon. Even
      well grown Mucuna plans had rotted with water stagnation in other beds.
result: failure
learning: >
  Tolerance to water logging: Black Gram, Peanut > Mucuna.  Mucuna needs to be
  established much before the NE monsoon. Best time till now has been March,
  April.

date: 2024-08-01
action: >
  Grew pigeon pea over the SE monsoon with flowers and first flush of pods ready in November.
expected: Rapid growth with NE monsoon rains and more flowers and pods after that in December.
observations:
  -
    date: 2024-12-26
    note: >
      Only plants which were on very high bunds survived. The rest which had more
      water logging or did not have deep roots, rotted away with the heavy rains.
      Black Gram and Peanut plants in the same bunds fared better.
result: mixed
learning: >
  Tolerance to Water Logging: Black Gram, Peanut > Pigeon pea.
  Plant pigeon pea earlier in July itself, so that they yield before NE monsoon.
  Also, it should be planted in higher ground if planted later.
---
date: 2024-11-01
action: >
  Pelletized pigeon pea seeds with the powdered clay using a pan.
expected: Usable seeds with thick clay coating.
observations:
  -
    date: 2024-11-02
    note: >
      The clay coating cracks on drying. Also takes more time to make a thicker coat.
result: mixed
learning: >
  Need to try adding compost to the mixture to reduce the cracking. Also for
  larger scale, I need to try a rotary mixer, probably a electrically operated
  concrete mixer.

action: >
  Powdered the dry clay pieces by grating against a french fry cutter that was
  lying useless in the kitchen. Then sieved using a fine mesh to get fine clay powder.
expected: >
  The process is not too much work.
observations:
  -
    date: 2024-11-01
    note: >
      The process lots of time and effort. Sometimes the finger gets cut on the grate.
result: mixed
learning: >
  Need to try the hand operated rotary grain mill or even a mixer grinder.
---
date: 2024-06-01
action: >
  Made clay from the soil on the farm using the process of levigation. Tied the
  clay and water mixture in an old dhoti and hung it from a tree branch for a
  week, for the water to drain.
expected: >
  Get good quality dry clay in a week for making seed balls / pellets.
observations:
  -
    date: 2024-06-08
    note: >
      A week is too long and the dhoti gets torn when separating the dry clay.
      The big pieces of dry clay need to be powdered for it to be usable, which is
      an additional work, that I didn't account for.
result: mixed
learning: >
  Need to remove the clay before it dries completely. Need effecient way to
  powder the large dried clay pieces.
