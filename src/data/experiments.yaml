  Broadcasted mucuna seeds on the first two trenches of Field 2 and hoed to
  cover them with soil.
crops:
  - mucuna
expected: >
  Expecting germination in two weeks and profuse growth throughout the year
  smothering other weeds. This should be better than previous attempt at growing
  mucuna on the beds, where the growth was poor doe to lack of moisture. Mucuna
  should die with water logging due to NE monsoon, and before it sets seeds.
  This will ensure that, the field is not infested with Mucuna the next season.

  Broadcasted Pigen Pea, Pulicha Keerai, Green Gram and Sunn Hemp seeds and then
  tilled the soil to kill the grass and weed cover on Field 3. The weed cover

  wet on the first day, but the rest of the weeks are expected to be dry.
crops:
  - pigeon pea
  - roselle
  - green gram

expected: >
  Likely the seeds will not germinate because of lack of moisture and also

  For untilled toil, it is better to till once without seeding. Then after
