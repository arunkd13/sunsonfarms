  Tilled Field 1, broadcasted black gram, rosella, ground nut and sunn hemp,
  raked them into the soil and irrigated field.
expected: >
  Good germination in a week and a good harvest.
result:
    eta: 2025-01-03

date: 2024-12-27
action: >
  Broadcasted Pigen Pea, Pulicha Keerai, Green Gram and Sunn Hemp seeds and then
  tilled the soil to kill the grass and weed cover. The weed cover was quite
  heavy even though this area has been cultivated for a year. Soil was wet on
  the first day, but the rest of the weeks are expected to be dry.
expected: >
  Likely the seeds will not germinate because of lack of moisture and also
  because they got buried too deep. I will need to broadcast seeds again and
  bury them once again, followed by immediate irrigation.
result:
  eta: 2025-01-03
  description: >
    There was some germination a week later.

date: 2024-12-04
action: >
  Transplanted beans that were damaged with water logging, onto drier bunds.
  This was on wet soil with adequete rains.
expected: Plants recover and grow with good yields.
result:
  eta: 2025-02-04

date: 2024-12-17
action: Sowed horsegram on high bunds in wet soil with some expected immediate rains.
expected: Good germination and growth

date: 2024-12-09
action: >
  Created trench around saplings with high mounds around stem to prevent damage
  from water logging.
expected: Saplings survive heavy NE monsoon.

date: 2024-12-01
action: >
  Winding trench on the crop field to drain heavy rain water and also used for
  irrigation.
expected: >
  Crops survive heavy NE monsoon. Should also be able to grow irrigated crop
  after rains.
result:
  eta: 2024-03-01
  description: >
    Irrigation on 2025-01-04 was smooth.

date: 2024-12-17
action: >
  Collected cow dung and started compost heap.
expected: >
  Able to get rich compost in less than 3 months. Should be able to use it for
  making seeed pellets and also for emergency fertilization for fruit saplings
  that show low growth.
result:
  eta: 2024-03-17

date: 2024-12-25
action: >
  Tilled bed that had never been tilled and containing heavy bermuda grass and
  other weeds. This was before the final heavy NE monsoon rains.
expected: >
  Able to broadcast seeds and lightly hoe once water has sufficiently drained
  after NE monsoon.
result:
  eta: 2025-01-25

action: >
  Planted custard apple seeds directly on mounds with wet soil condition and
  likely rains in a few days.
expected: >
  Seeds germinate in NE monsoon in a month or two
result:
  eta: 2025-02-17

date: 2024-11-13
action: >
  Sowed horsegram directly on untilled soil with thick grass cover and had to
  deep hoe it. Seeds were buried more than 3 inches. Soil was wet with rains
  that day.
expected: >
  Horsegram germinates with NE monsoon rains in a week.
result:
  eta: 2024-12-01
  state: failure
  description: Just one or two seeds germinated.
learning: >
  For untilled toil, it is better to till once without seeding. Then after
  letting the plant mass to dry, the area can be seeded and then either raked or
  lightly hoed to bury the seeds at a lower depth.

action: >
  Sowed Mucuna on the bunds of the winding irrigation trench. This was just
  before the heavy NE monsoon rains.
expected: >
  Mucuna germinates with the rains and grow profusely with the ample water fromt
  he NE monsoon rains.
result:
  state: failure
  description: >
    Mucuna seeds likely rotted due to water logging from heavy NE monsoon. Even
    well grown Mucuna plans had rotted with water stagnation in other beds.
learning: >
  Tolerance to water logging: Black Gram, Peanut > Mucuna.  Mucuna needs to be
  established much before the NE monsoon. Best time till now has been March,
  April.

  Grew pigeon pea over the SE monsoon with flowers and first flush of pods ready in November.
expected: Rapid growth with NE monsoon rains and more flowers and pods after that in December.
result:
  state: mixed
  description: >
    Only plants which were on very high bunds survived. The rest which had more
    water logging or did not have deep roots, rotted away with the heavy rains.
    Black Gram and Peanut plants in the same bunds fared better.
learning: >
  Tolerance to Water Logging: Black Gram, Peanut > Pigeon pea.
  Plant pigeon pea earlier in July itself, so that they yielf before NE monsoon.
  Also, it should be planted in higher ground if planted later.

date: 2024-11-01
action: >
  Pelletized pigeon pea seeds with the powdered clay using a pan.
expected: Usable seeds with thick clay coating.
result:
  state: mixed
  description: >
    The clay coating cracks on drying. Also takes more time to make a thicker coat.
learning: >
  Need to try adding compost to the mixture to reduce the cracking. Also for
  larger scale, I need to try a rotary mixer, probably a electrically operated
  concrete mixer.

  Powdered the dry clay pieces by grating against a french fry cutter that was
  lying useless in the kitchen. Then sieved using a fine mesh to get fine clay powder.
expected: >
  The process is not too much work.
result:
  state: mixed
  description: >
    The process lots of time and effort. Sometimes the finger gets cut on the grate.
learning: >
  Need to try the hand operated rotary grain mill or even a mixer grinder.

action: >
  Made clay from the soil on the farm using the process of levigation. Tied the
  clay and water mixture in an old dhoti and hung it from a tree branch for a
  week, for the water to drain.
expected: >
  Get good quality dry clay in a week for making seed balls / pellets.
result:
  state: mixed
  description: >
    A week is too long and the dhoti gets torn when separating the dry clay.
    The big pieces of dry clay need to be powdered for it to be usable, which is
    an additional work, that I didn't account for.
learning: >
  Need to remove the clay before it dries completely. Need effecient way to
  powder the large dried clay pieces.
